# Bosnia—Srebrenica & beyond (1992–95)

## A. Opening Vignette

*In July 1995, a terrified populace streamed into Srebrenica, seeking refuge in what the United Nations had declared a "safe area," guarded by lightly armed Dutch peacekeepers. Thousands of Muslim men and boys, separated from their families, gathered under the gaze of Bosnian Serb forces, commanded by General Ratko Mladić. The air was thick with the stench of fear and the dust of displacement. Promised safe passage, the men were instead led away, loaded onto buses, or marched into dense forests. The distant sound of gunshots, initially sporadic, grew into a chilling crescendo. The world watched, but did not intervene, as a methodical slaughter unfolded, etching the name Srebrenica into the grim annals of modern genocide, a stark reminder of humanity's capacity for organized cruelty, even under the eyes of international protectors.*

## B. Historical Context

The Bosnian War (1992-1995) erupted following the breakup of Yugoslavia, as Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence. This sparked a conflict among its three main ethnic groups: Bosnian Serbs (Orthodox Christian), Bosniaks (Muslim), and Bosnian Croats (Catholic). Bosnian Serbs, supported by Serbia and aiming to create a "Greater Serbia," sought to connect Serb-majority areas and ethnically cleanse territories they considered strategically important. Bosniaks, advocating for a multi-ethnic and independent Bosnia, became the primary victims of widespread ethnic cleansing campaigns, particularly in eastern Bosnia. Srebrenica was one of six UN-declared "safe areas" intended to protect civilians but was ultimately overrun.

## C. Chronology of Events

* **April 1992:** Bosnian War begins following Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of independence. Bosnian Serb forces, supported by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA)/Serbia, launch offensives.
* **1992-1995:** Widespread "ethnic cleansing" campaigns by Bosnian Serb forces against Bosniak and Croat populations across Bosnia, involving systematic killings, forced displacement, rape, and concentration camps.
* **April 1993:** Srebrenica is declared a UN "safe area," but remains inadequately protected and besieged.
* **July 6-11, 1995:** Bosnian Serb Army (VRS) under General Ratko Mladić launches its final offensive on Srebrenica. Dutch UN peacekeepers are overwhelmed.
* **July 11-22, 1995:** Over 8,000 Bosniak men and boys from Srebrenica are systematically separated, transported, and executed by VRS forces in the surrounding areas. Mass graves are created. Women, children, and elderly are forcibly displaced.
* **August 1995:** NATO launches airstrikes against Bosnian Serb positions (Operation Deliberate Force) following the Srebrenica massacre and a market bombing in Sarajevo.
* **December 1995:** Dayton Peace Accords are signed, ending the war.

## D. Atrocity Pattern

The Bosnian War, and particularly the Srebrenica genocide, demonstrated a brutal array of cruelty. **Mass executions** were the dominant modality at Srebrenica, where Bosniak men and boys were systematically rounded up, often blindfolded and bound, then shot. **Forced displacement** ("ethnic cleansing") was a widespread pattern throughout the war, involving the forced removal of populations from their homes. **Sexual violence**, especially systematic rape of Bosniak women and girls, was used as a deliberate tool of war and ethnic cleansing, aimed at terrorizing, humiliating, and destroying the social fabric of the targeted group. **Concentration camps** (e.g., Omarska, Keraterm, Trnopolje) were established where Bosniaks and Croats were subjected to severe physical abuse, torture, starvation, and extrajudicial killings. The destruction of cultural and religious sites (mosques, churches) was also a deliberate tactic to erase the targeted group's presence.

## E. Psychological & Societal Drivers

The Bosnian War exemplified how **shattered authority** (the collapse of Yugoslavia) and intense **social chaos** can quickly escalate into extreme mass homicide. **Propaganda and target group construction** were crucial, as Bosnian Serb media and political leaders systematically demonized Bosniaks as "fundamentalist Islamic extremists" or "Turks," drawing on historical narratives of Ottoman rule. This **dehumanization** facilitated the **moral disengagement** of perpetrators. **Group polarization** occurred as political leaders solidified ethnic divisions, pushing populations towards extreme nationalist stances. **Obedience to authority** within military and paramilitary structures, coupled with a pervasive culture of fear and impunity, enabled widespread participation in atrocities. The concept of **situational transitions** is particularly relevant: ordinary individuals, immersed in a climate of intense nationalism, fear, and wartime violence, were transformed into perpetrators, driven by ideology, peer pressure, and the perceived existential threat from the "other" group.

## F. Aftermath & Legacy

The Bosnian War resulted in approximately 100,000 deaths and the displacement of over 2.2 million people. The Srebrenica massacre was officially recognized as an act of genocide by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICTY, established in 1993, prosecuted numerous high-ranking political and military leaders, including Slobodan Milošević (who died before verdict), Radovan Karadžić, and Ratko Mladić, for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The legacy for Bosnia and Herzegovina is a fragile peace, deeply entrenched ethnic divisions, and ongoing challenges of reconciliation and return for displaced persons. For survivors, the trauma is profound and intergenerational. Memory politics remains contentious, with continued denial of the Srebrenica genocide by some Serb political entities, while Bosniaks strive for full recognition and justice.
