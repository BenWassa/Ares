# Nanking Massacre (1937)

## A. Opening Vignette

*In December 1937, the ancient city of Nanking, China, fell to the Imperial Japanese Army. What followed was not merely occupation but an unleashing of unimaginable horror. For weeks, the city became a canvas for unrestrained brutality. Sounds of machine guns ripped through the air, interspersed with the screams of women and the desperate pleas of men. Japanese soldiers, having fought a brutal campaign, descended upon civilians and disarmed soldiers, turning the city into a killing ground. Streets overflowed with corpses, homes became sites of systematic rape, and entire families were wiped out. The few foreign observers trapped within the city bore witness, their diaries detailing a descent into pure savagery, a systematic dehumanization of an entire populace under the guise of conquest.*

## B. Historical Context

The Nanking Massacre (also known as the Rape of Nanking) occurred during the Second Sino-Japanese War. After fierce resistance, the Chinese Nationalist government abandoned its capital city, Nanking, leaving behind a significant civilian population and many disarmed or surrendered Chinese soldiers. The Imperial Japanese Army, under the command of General Iwane Matsui, entered the city on December 13, 1937. Japanese military doctrine at the time often emphasized ruthless discipline and contempt for those who surrendered. The ferocity of the prior Shanghai campaign, combined with a sense of racial superiority and deep-seated animosity towards the Chinese, contributed to an environment where military restraint collapsed, leading to uncontrolled violence against both combatants and civilians.

## C. Chronology of Events

* **July 1937:** Second Sino-Japanese War begins.
* **November 1937:** Shanghai falls to Japanese forces after heavy fighting, preceding their advance on Nanking.
* **December 9, 1937:** Japanese forces issue an ultimatum for Nanking's surrender.
* **December 13, 1937:** Japanese troops enter Nanking. Organized mass killings and atrocities begin immediately.
* **December 1937 - January 1938:** The peak period of the massacre and widespread atrocities, lasting approximately six weeks.
* **February 1938:** The violence begins to subside, but systematic killings and harassment continue on a smaller scale for several more weeks.

## D. Atrocity Pattern

The Nanking Massacre involved a horrifying spectrum of cruelty. **Mass executions** were rampant, targeting both surrendered Chinese soldiers (often machine-gunned or bayoneted in large groups) and civilians. Common methods included beheading, burning, burial alive, and live target practice. **Widespread and systematic rape** of women and girls of all ages was a hallmark of the atrocity, often followed by mutilation or murder. Soldiers engaged in **looting, arson, and destruction** across the city. **Torture** was common, including disembowelment, dismemberment, and other forms of extreme physical abuse. Competitive killing contests between Japanese soldiers were also reported. The violence was characterized by its indiscriminate nature and the active participation of a significant portion of the Japanese soldiery, often sanctioned by their immediate commanders.

## E. Psychological & Societal Drivers

The Nanking Massacre highlights the role of **dehumanization** and the breakdown of military discipline. Chinese civilians and soldiers were systematically stripped of their humanity through Japanese propaganda and military training, often referred to as "Chinks" or "inferior beings." This facilitated **moral disengagement**, allowing soldiers to commit horrific acts without empathy. The intense **group cohesion** within military units, combined with the extreme pressures of a brutal war, fostered a "pack mentality" where individual soldiers felt compelled to participate in or condone violence. **Obedience to authority** (or the lack thereof in restraining violence) and the **shattered authority** of the defeated Chinese government created a vacuum where a conquering army felt no constraint. The **situational transitions** were rapid: soldiers, often brutalized by their own harsh training and combat experiences, found themselves in a conquered city with no effective resistance, leading to an explosion of pent-up aggression and a breakdown of moral boundaries. The lack of accountability from higher command further perpetuated the atrocities.

## F. Aftermath & Legacy

The Nanking Massacre resulted in an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 deaths, though precise figures remain debated. Many Japanese records were destroyed, and official denial remains a significant aspect of its legacy. After World War II, the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE) in Tokyo tried some Japanese leaders for war crimes related to Nanking, and General Matsui was convicted and executed. However, broader accountability for many perpetrators was limited. For China, Nanking remains a profound national trauma and a symbol of Japanese wartime brutality, deeply influencing Sino-Japanese relations. In Japan, there is still significant historical revisionism and denial regarding the full extent and nature of the atrocities, leading to ongoing historical disputes. Memorials and museums in Nanking strive to preserve the memory and educate future generations about the event.
