# Rwandan Genocide (1994)

## A. Opening Vignette

*The evening of April 6, 1994, brought an ominous calm to Kigali. Then, the night sky erupted. News spread like wildfire: the plane carrying President Habyarimana had been shot down. Within hours, the carefully cultivated veneer of peace shattered. Roadblocks materialized, manned by uniformed soldiers and frenzied interahamwe militia, their machetes glinting under the dim streetlights. Lists were produced, names called out. Neighbors turned on neighbors. The radio, once a source of news, became a weapon, spewing venomous commands to "cut down the tall trees." Families huddled in terror, their pleas for help met with deafening silence from the world outside. The systematic slaughter of Tutsis began, a relentless torrent of violence that would consume over a million lives in just 100 days.*

## B. Historical Context

The Rwandan Genocide was the systematic extermination of the Tutsi ethnic group and moderate Hutu political opponents by Hutu extremist elements in Rwanda. It occurred over approximately 100 days from April to July 1994. The roots of the conflict lie in colonial-era policies (Belgian rule) that exacerbated pre-existing social distinctions between Hutu and Tutsi, establishing a rigid hierarchy and favoring Tutsis, who were presented as superior. Post-independence, Hutu majority rule led to decades of ethnic tension, discrimination, and intermittent violence against Tutsis. A civil war between the Hutu-led government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a Tutsi rebel group based in Uganda, further escalated divisions. The assassination of President Juv√©nal Habyarimana on April 6, 1994, served as the immediate trigger for the meticulously planned genocide.

## C. Chronology of Events

* **1959-1962:** Hutu Revolution and independence from Belgium; mass exodus of Tutsis, and establishment of Hutu-dominated government.
* **Early 1990s:** Rwandan Civil War between the Hutu government and the Tutsi-led RPF begins. Extremist Hutu propaganda intensifies, demonizing Tutsis.
* **August 1993:** Arusha Accords signed, a power-sharing agreement between the government and RPF, viewed as a betrayal by Hutu extremists.
* **April 6, 1994:** President Habyarimana's plane is shot down, widely blamed on Hutu extremists eager to avoid implementing the Accords.
* **April 7, 1994:** Genocide begins. Hutu Power factions take control, implement roadblocks, and begin systematic killings of Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana and ten Belgian UN peacekeepers are murdered.
* **April - July 1994:** Widespread slaughter across the country by the Rwandan Army (FAR), Presidential Guard, Gendarmerie, and civilian militias (Interahamwe, Impuzamugambi), often using machetes and clubs. UN peacekeepers are largely withdrawn.
* **July 4, 1994:** RPF captures Kigali.
* **Mid-July 1994:** RPF gains control of the country, ending the genocide. A new government is formed, and millions of Hutus (including perpetrators) flee to Zaire (now DRC).

## D. Atrocity Pattern

The Rwandan Genocide was characterized by its extreme brutality, speed, and intimate nature. The primary modalities of cruelty were **machete attacks and bludgeoning**, often carried out by neighbors or acquaintances, highlighting the community-level participation. **Mass shootings** also occurred, particularly at churches, schools, and hospitals where Tutsis sought refuge. **Sexual violence**, including widespread, systematic rape, was a pervasive weapon of war and genocide, used to terrorize, humiliate, and destroy Tutsi women and their communities. **Torture** was employed to extract information or simply to inflict suffering. **Forced starvation and dehydration** occurred as people were trapped without access to food or water. The organized nature of the violence, facilitated by government lists, radio incitement, and the distribution of weapons, transformed ordinary citizens into perpetrators, often under explicit or implicit coercion.

## E. Psychological & Societal Drivers

The Rwandan Genocide offers a stark illustration of extreme **group polarization** and **dehumanization**. For decades, Hutu extremist propaganda systematically demonized Tutsis as "inyenzi" (cockroaches) and foreign invaders, making their extermination seem like a necessary cleansing. This profound dehumanization was crucial for **moral disengagement**, allowing perpetrators to commit horrific acts against people they knew. **Obedience to authority** was paramount, as directives came from government officials, military leaders, and local authorities, reinforced by incessant radio broadcasts. The "Law of Compliance" meant that those who refused to participate risked being killed themselves, highlighting the powerful **situational transitions** that compelled participation. The **shattered authority** of the Arusha Accords and the **social chaos** following the president's assassination provided the window for extremist elements to seize control and unleash the pre-planned violence. This case profoundly demonstrates how a highly centralized political system can mobilize ordinary citizens for mass atrocity through ideological indoctrination and the systematic elimination of dissent.

## F. Aftermath & Legacy

The Rwandan Genocide claimed the lives of an estimated 800,000 to over 1 million Tutsis and moderate Hutus, roughly 70% of the Tutsi population, in just 100 days. The country was left in ruins, with profound social, economic, and psychological trauma. The international community faced severe criticism for its failure to intervene effectively. In response, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) was established in Arusha, Tanzania, prosecuting high-level perpetrators. Domestically, Rwanda implemented a unique traditional justice system called Gacaca courts, which processed hundreds of thousands of cases at the community level, focusing on truth, accountability, and reconciliation. The legacy for Rwanda is a complex journey of healing, national unity (discouraging ethnic identification), and rebuilding. The memory of the genocide is central to Rwandan identity, serving as a powerful lesson in prevention and the dangers of hatred and inaction.
