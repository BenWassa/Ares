## 2. Key Definitions & Typology

The authors introduce "Extreme Mass Homicide" as an overarching construct to encompass various forms of large-scale, intentional killing perpetrated by groups, providing a framework for comparative analysis. To achieve conceptual clarity, the paper distinguishes between specific categories of mass violence:

| Term               | Definition                                                                                                        | Key Characteristics                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| **Massacre**       | The deliberate and indiscriminate killing of a large number of defenseless people, often in a short period.         | Typically localized, often occurs during warfare or civil unrest, perpetrators may be military or paramilitary, aims to terrorize or eliminate immediate threats/opposition, less systematic destruction of an entire group. |
| **Genocide**       | Acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group.      | Systemic, state-sponsored or state-condoned, aims at the eradication of a defined group, involves organized logistics (deportation, extermination camps), prolonged duration, ideological justification.        |
| **Political Slaughter** | Large-scale killings carried out by a state or political entity against its own citizens or specific groups for political reasons, without necessarily aiming for complete eradication of an entire ethno-racial group. | Often targets political opponents, dissidents, or specific social classes; may involve purges, forced disappearances, or widespread executions; distinct from genocide by lack of intent to destroy a "group as such." |

This precise typology allows for a more rigorous examination of the unique and overlapping features of these atrocities, moving beyond general classifications to identify specific patterns of intent, organization, and execution.
